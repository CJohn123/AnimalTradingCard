        <p> Medium-sized cats have thick and smoky fur coat & rosette spots
        patterns that blend well with the rocky mountains. Snow leopard's
        diet varies based on the availability of food, but they typically
        eat sheep and goat. Due to several years of prey and habitat loss
        & poaching, these majestic animals have become endangered.</p>
